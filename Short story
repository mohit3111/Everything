The Fable of the Preacher Who Flew His Kite, But Not Because He Wished to Do So
by George Ade
The Fable of the Preacher Who Flew His Kite, But Not Because He Intended to Do So was published in Fables in Slang (1899). Enjoy Ade's sardonic story about a preacher whose sermon make-over is a hit. Ade's style is reminiscent of his mentor, Mark Twain.
An illustration for the story The Fable of the Preacher Who Flew His Kite, But Not Because He Wished to Do So by the author George Ade
A certain Preacher became wise to the Fact that he was not making a Hit with his Congregation. The Parishioners did not seem inclined to seek him out after Services and tell him he was a Pansy. He suspected that they were Rapping him on the Quiet. The Preacher knew there must be something wrong with his Talk. He had been trying to Expound in a clear and straightforward Manner, omitting Foreign Quotations, setting up for illustration of his Points such Historical Characters as were familiar to his Hearers, putting the stubby Old English words ahead of the Latin, and rather flying low along the Intellectual Plane of the Aggregation that chipped in to pay his Salary. But the Pew-Holders were not tickled. They could Understand everything he said, and they began to think he was Common.

So he studied the Situation and decided that if he wanted to Win them and make everybody believe he was a Nobby and Boss Minister he would have to hand out a little Guff. He fixed it up Good and Plenty.
